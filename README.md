# Image identification and recognition using novel hybrid architecture for satellite images
In this project we are building a novel hybrid architecture to detect satellite and asteroids from the given image
The project is done Google Collab so that we need not to worry about our system's RAM and GPU consumption.
The steps to implement are given below:

Step 1 : Download the source code from github or directly open from the github. <br/>
Step 2 : Run the first section so that it downloads all the important packages that is needed for this project will be imported.
Step 3 : Run dataset, utils and model section
Step 4 : Don't run the training section as the model is already trained. If it is needed you ca run training section but it will take nearly 1-2 hours to train
Step 5 : Run the inference section which takes a random image from the test dataset and gives the output image with the bounding boxes around satellites and asteroids.
