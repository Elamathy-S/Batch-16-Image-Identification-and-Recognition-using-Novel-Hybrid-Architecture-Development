# Image identification and recognition using novel hybrid architecture for satellite images
In this project we are building a novel hybrid architecture to detect satellite and asteroids from the given image<br/>
The project is done Google Collab so that we need not to worry about our system's RAM and GPU consumption.<br/><br/>
The steps to implement are given below:<br/>

Step 1 : Download the source code from github or directly open from the github. <br/>
Step 2 : Run the first section so that it downloads all the important packages that is needed for this project will be imported.<br/>
Step 3 : Run dataset, utils and model section<br/>
Step 4 : Don't run the training section as the model is already trained. If it is needed you can run training section but it will take nearly 1-2 hours to train<br/>
Step 5 : Run the inference section which takes a random image from the test dataset and gives the output image with the bounding boxes around satellites and asteroids.<br/>
